- GNU Compiler Collection (GNU-CC) 
- Alternatively one can use other G++/C++ standard ports too like Cygwin
- Most of the calls/libraries used are standard in nature and can be easily found in the latest implementations of C++ compilers
- Calls do not stick to POSIX compliancy (ignore any hard details on that)

## Thoughts and Future developments
- This is memorable : my first large project and a fairly comprehensive programming experience
- First project that has working utility
- No further developments required
